        <p>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is one of the shows that closed in March 2020 and will reopen this season. Performances start Nov. 12.</p>

        <p>Tourists can’t wait to see shows return to the Great White Way.</p>
        <p>People interviewed around Bryant Park all feel the masking and vaccination requirements enforced by venues are sufficient measures for reopening theaters safely, even at full capacity. That view is key if the industry is to survive the pandemic.</p>

            <p>Though New Yorkers have better access to Broadway theaters, speaking to out-of-towners provides a clearer model of what the future holds for the city’s theater industry, which relies on tourism.</p>

            <p>“There’s nothing like watching theater,” Emi Maggi, 24, said. He contrasted it with the all-online videoconferencing culture that has become commonplace as a necessity of the pandemic—the live aspect, seeing people perform in person.</p>

        <div class="icons">

            <p>He and Natalia Huertas, 28, are two fresh-faced acting students, proudly displaying a drawstring bag emblazoned with the words “The American Academy of Dramatic Arts.” Maggi and Huertas flew in from Mexico and Texas, respectively, to complete a summer acting program. The course ended Friday, but the two expect to stay in New York City another week to catch a performance of “Hadestown,” which reopens Sept. 2.</p>

            <p>Jen Bisgay, 52, a stay-at-home mom from Scotch Plains, New Jersey, thinks the return of the Broadway industry will be a boon for the city’s economy. She won’t be seeing any plays soon; her husband, Steve Bisgay, 54, chimes in saying that they’ve seen most of the shows that will open its’ doors in the coming month. They’ll wait for “Dear Evan Hansen” to return to the stage in Dec. 11.</p>
        </div>
        <p>All of these people reflect the typical audience for Broadway theaters. Tourists account for about two-thirds of ticket sales according to The New York Times, so it’s imperative for the theater industry that these people feel comfortable coming to New York City and rubbing shoulders with thousands of people in one room. </p>
        <p>Broadway cannot survive without the revenue from out-of-towners, especially when, as Variety reports, shows can lose money with a third of the seats empty.</p>
        <p>Some producers are willing to gamble with seventeen shows slated to open or reopen by the end of September according to the Theatre Development Fund. One benefit for these risk-takers: there will be less competition to vie for tourists’ ticket sales.</p>
