            <span class="dateline">NEW YORK —</span>
            Tourists can’t wait to see shows return to the Great White Way.
        </p>
        <p>People interviewed around Bryant Park all feel the masking and vaccination requirements enforced by venues are sufficient measures for reopening theaters safely, even at full capacity. That view is key if the industry is to survive the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Though New Yorkers have better access to Broadway theaters, speaking to out-of-towners provides a clearer model of what the future holds for the city’s theater industry, which relies on tourism.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Most respondents hailed from the tri-state area. Two were from New Jersey, one was from upstate New York and a family of three was from Connecticut. One respondent each flew in from Texas, Florida and Mexico.</p>
        </div>
        <p>“There’s nothing like watching theater,” Emi Maggi, 24, said. He contrasted it with the all-online videoconferencing culture that has become commonplace as a necessity of the pandemic—the live aspect, seeing people perform in person.</p>
        <p>He and Natalia Huertas, 28, are two fresh-faced acting students, proudly displaying a drawstring bag emblazoned with the words “The American Academy of Dramatic Arts.” Maggi and Huertas flew in from Mexico and Texas, respectively, to complete a summer acting program. The course ended Friday, but the two expect to stay in New York City another week to catch a performance of “Hadestown,” which reopens Sept. 2.</p>

            <p>Only 17 shows are slated to return to performances by the end of September. That’s out of the 45 shows expected to reopen by the middle of 2022. At the very least, those 17 shows won’t have much competition for tourists' cash.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Jen Bisgay, 52, a stay-at-home mom from Scotch Plains, New Jersey, thinks the return of the Broadway industry will be a boon for the city’s economy. She won’t be seeing any plays soon; her husband, Steve Bisgay, 54, chimes in saying that they’ve seen most of the shows that will open its’ doors in the coming month. They’ll wait for “Dear Evan Hansen” to return to the stage in Dec. 11.</p>
        <p>All of these people reflect the typical audience for Broadway theaters. Tourists account for about two-thirds of ticket sales according to The New York Times, so it’s imperative for the theater industry that these people feel comfortable coming to New York City and rubbing shoulders with thousands of people in one room.</p>

            <p>In normal years, the percent of Broadway audiences from outside the city is over 70%. Only recent years have seen the figure dip below the 80% mark.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Broadway cannot survive without the revenue from out-of-towners, especially when, as Variety reports, shows can lose money with a third of the seats empty.</p>
        <p>Some producers are willing to gamble with seventeen shows slated to open or reopen by the end of September according to the Theatre Development Fund. One benefit for these risk-takers: there will be less competition to vie for tourists’ ticket sales.</p>

            <p>This survey provides an incomplete picture of tourists to the city. All respondents already felt safe enough to come to the city. Anyone avoiding the city altogether, and by extension Broadway, would be missed! Indeed, the numbers (as of April) at one of the city’s busiest tourist destinations shows that it is seeing less than half of its usual visitor count.</p>
