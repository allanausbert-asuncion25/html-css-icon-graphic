HTML/CSS Icon Graphic
Create a graphic related to a news story you are working on.

Your graphic should include the following elements:
    Headline.
    Dateline and byline.
    At least four icons that represent some important facet of your story.
    Write a short paragraph that conveys an important data point attached to each icon as it relates to the news story.
    Build the graphic using ONLY HTML and CSS.
    Use pre-designed, royalty-free icons (font awesome!).
    Include a link to your data at the bottom of your page.
    You MUST use the design principles we’ve discussed — pay attention to font, hierarchy, spacing and color.
